I like her so much to the point that I can't let her go even if she wants to end our relationship because of the other people around us most especially her family. I do the things for her that I'm not used to for a girl and I am willing to sacrifice everything just to have a little time with her. A little and limited time that I'm asking from her but she don't wanna give it to me. She's scared that someone might see us, that she's still having an affair with me. I love her and I want to be with her at least once a week even if just for a limited time. I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing, all of my friends told me to stop it and just let it go 2 months is just 2 months not a deep relationship. But they don't feel what I feel, in this span of time I learned a lot, I learned how to love, to be loved, to sacrifice a good life, and to sacrifice a better clear future. My mind tells me to stop, but my heart tells me to hold, don't give up, stay with her and give her the unconditional love. Should I follow my mind or follow my heart?\",\n",
